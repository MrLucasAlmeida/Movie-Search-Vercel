### Movie Search on Vercel
This is an attemp at making [this](https://github.com/MrLucasAlmeida/Movie-Search) (another project of mine) project while hosting it on Vercel and Render. It worked locally but not with client and server hosting.

# Update
Got it working using just render to host the frontend and backend. Check it out [HERE](https://movie-search-app-frontend.onrender.com/).

### What I Learned
* To create a backend from scratch using Express, Cors
* How to add environment variables (API Key and Port)
